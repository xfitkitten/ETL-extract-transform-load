- Database
- API
- File Store
- Documents(ex. CSV)

The data being ingested from your source is likely to not be in a format that is usable or efficient for your use case. This takes us to the next step in the process

# Transform

The transform step of this process is where the magic happens. In the transform step, we will process the data that has been extracted, in preparation of loading into our destination system or data store. 

- Cleansing of Data
- Data Verification
- Filtering
- Splitting and Merging

# Load

Loading data is the last step of the process. This is where we move our transformed data to it's final resting place.
