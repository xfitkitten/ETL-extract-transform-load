## Congrats on the new role!

You have landed a sweet new job at a crypto/blockchain data startup. There goal is to make it easier for folks to get into crypto by crunching data and providing easy ways for them to interface with it so that people are empowered to make their own decisions. 

This Repo will take you through what it's like building an application in the real world.

## Your Mission

We're new, so to get up to speed, the company has tasked us with building a small project that might grow into a much bigger product later. This app will take historical data of crypto prices and allow users to filter and compare data between them easily. We will also be building tests to ensure the featues of this application are working correctly.

All data necessary will be available in the root of this repo....for now...

:bulb: Pro Tip!
